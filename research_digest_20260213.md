Paper: Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment

Authors: Jacky Kwok, Xilun Zhang, Mengdi Xu et al.

Categories: cs.RO, cs.AI, eess.SY

Published: 2026-02-12 18:59 UTC

Summary: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We f...

Paper: Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging

Authors: Jialun Liu, David Yang, Ian Robinson

Categories: physics.optics, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.comp-ph

Published: 2026-02-12 18:42 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense f...

Paper: UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling

Authors: Leon Liangyu Chen, Haoyu Ma, Zhipeng Fan et al.

Categories: cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG

Published: 2026-02-12 18:59 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and makin... 

#===================================================#

Why it matters: Paper 9: UniT is explicitly categorized under computer vision (cs.CV) and presents a groundbreaking unified multimodal model that integrates vision tasks with test-time scaling, representing significant innovation in deep computer vision research.

Paper: Any House Any Task: Scalable Long-Horizon Planning for Abstract Human Tasks

Authors: Zhihong Liu, Yang Li, Rengming Huang et al.

Categories: cs.RO

Published: 2026-02-12 18:28 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexi...
