Paper: Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging

Authors: Shuhong Liu, Xining Ge, Ziying Gu et al.

Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG

Published: 2026-01-30 18:47 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing constraints, while standard calibration pipelines mainly remove structured artifacts and leave stochastic noise largely unresolved. Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a ...

Paper: Training-Free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance in Vision-Language Models

Authors: Yi Zhang, Chun-Wun Cheng, Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero et al.

Categories: cs.CV, cs.LG

Published: 2026-01-30 18:21 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a...

Paper: User Prompting Strategies and Prompt Enhancement Methods for Open-Set Object Detection in XR Environments

Authors: Junfeng Lin, Yanming Xiu, Maria Gorlatova

Categories: cs.CV

Published: 2026-01-30 18:55 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Open-set object detection (OSOD) localizes objects while identifying and rejecting unknown classes at inference. While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two O...

Paper: Structured Over Scale: Learning Spatial Reasoning from Educational Video

Authors: Bishoy Galoaa, Xiangyu Bai, Sarah Ostadabbas

Categories: cs.CV

Published: 2026-01-30 18:20 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these ca...

Paper: VideoGPA: Distilling Geometry Priors for 3D-Consistent Video Generation

Authors: Hongyang Du, Junjie Ye, Xiaoyan Cong et al.

Categories: cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG

Published: 2026-01-30 18:59 UTC

Source: Arxiv

Summary: While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference A...
